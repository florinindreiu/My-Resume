# My-Resume

Here is My Resume, developed using only HTML and CSS - Flexbox, Bootstrap.  
The site is responsive on desktop, tablets and smartphones.  
I've used 2 font families, and used 5 colors maximum.  
The items are aligned mostly using flexbox - justify-content and align-items.  
Working Experience and Skills buttons are bringing you to their section. I've used an ID for the sections, and an -a href="id"- on the buttons.  
I've used list-group for the Working Experience and Education section.  
An important thing for the responsiveness of the website is using the media query.  
Least, I've used buttons on the bottom right corner to take you to my Linkedin, Github and Insta account.
